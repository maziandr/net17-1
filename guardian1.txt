 Totally tropical: how to wear the season's hottest trend

Rousseau tropical

Henri Rousseau – a former customs officer – was what you might call an armchair traveller. He liked to say his paintings 
of tigers in lush green jungles were inspired by his time in Mexico but it was more likely to have been the botanical 
gardens in Paris. Make-believe or not, the photo-realistic look works really well on a pair of trousers.

Club Tropicana

Paying homage to George Michael through clothes is a challenge we have set ourselves for 2017. This is the route-one 
way to do that – a Hawaiian shirt is everything to an 80s summer, like open-back jeeps, inflatables and, of course, 
drinks that are free. Update by wearing loose and louche, in a pyjama shape.

Fruit-basket tropical

OK, so Holland’s weather in the 18th century was, we can safely assume, hardly the kind to melt your iPhone. But the 
aesthetic of Dutch and Flemish vanitas painting – full of very symbolic exotic fruit, flowers and butterflies – is an 
old-school take on tropical and a bit of a sleeper trend. Combine pomegranates with skulls and a general malaise regarding 
the futility of life for the full look.

How about a contribution for each item bought towards protecting the very rainforests and other vulnerable areas of our planet 
that inspire these designs?

I'm waiting for a designer to conceive a proper gussetless suit. Something to expose the natural beauty of ya under carriage at all times

Oh yes the link of the garment print to the art shown is at best dubious - we have Gucci to thank for this notion of trend this season - the most hideous concept
I guess this is what's called making an exhibition of oneself;)

I'd have loved to see Elizabeth Taylor in her amazing caftans - who makes them and how can I buy some?

Try the Jungle Print tea dress at online shop Sosandar for the closest thing to the Rousseau print.

Topshop again? Promoting that disgusting Philip Green?
